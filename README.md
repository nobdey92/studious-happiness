## APIs

`API` stands for `Application Programming Interface`. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. `APIs` define how different components of software systems should *interact and exchange data*.

`APIs` can be used for various purposes, such as retrieving data from external sources, sending data to external systems, performing specific actions, or integrating different services together. They provide a standardized way for developers to `access` and `manipulate` `data`, `services`, or `functionalities` offered by *other software systems*.

## Input / Output

Have you ever played a game where you need to give it some information, and it gives you a response or outcome? That's similar to how `input` and `output` work in programming! `Input` is the information or data that you provide to a program, and `output` is the result or response that the program gives back to you.

### Input

In programming, `input` can come from *various sources* such as `user interactions`, `files`, `databases`, or even `other programs`. 

For example, when you type your name into a form on a website or send a message to a chatbot, you're providing `input` to the program. `Input` can be in the form of `string`, `numbers`, `arrays`, `or any other data type` that the program expects.

### Output

`Output` is the result or response generated by a program based on the `input` it receives. It can be displayed on the screen, stored in a file, sent to another program or server, or used for further processing within the program. 

For example, when you submit a form on a website and see a confirmation message or receive search results from a search engine, that's the `output` generated by the program.

Programs use algorithms and logic to process the `input` data and generate the desired `output`. The specific `input` and `output` mechanisms depend on the programming language and the context in which the program is running.

In summary, `input` is the information you give to a program, and `output` is the result or response that the program gives back to you.

## CRUD Operations / REST Verbs

`CRUD` stands for `Create`, `Read`, `Update`, and `Delete`. These are the fundamental operations for manipulating data in many applications and databases.

### Create

The `Create` operation refers to adding new data or resources to a system. It involves *sending data* to the `API` or `database` to `create` a new entry.

### Read

The `Read` operation is used to `retrieve` or `fetch` existing data from the `API` or `database`. It allows you to access specific records or collections of `data`.

### Update

The `Update` operation is used to `modify` or `update` existing data in the `API` or `database`. It involves *sending updated data* to the `API` to `modify` the existing records.

### Delete

The `Delete` operation is used to `remove` or `delete` specific `data` or `resources` from the `API` or `database`. It involves *sending a request* to the `API` to `delete` a particular record or collection of data.

`CRUD Operations` provide a standard set of actions that developers can perform on data through `APIs`. By supporting these `operations`, `APIs` enable developers to interact with and *manipulate data* stored in *external systems*.

For example, if you have a *social media application*, you might use `CRUD` `operations` to `create` new user profiles, `read` or `fetch` posts from users' feeds, `update` user information, and `delete` posts or user accounts when requested.

By understanding `CRUD` `operations` and how they relate to `APIs`, developers can effectively work with `data` and perform necessary ``operations`` on *external systems* or `databases`.
